# Simple Punch Out Game MOO ICT

In this tutorial we will be making something very exciting. Classic Mike Tyson Punch Out was one of my most favorite game on my old school Nintendo and I loved playing it.  This was a difficult tutorial to get off the ground because most of the algorithm for the game had to be written ground up and made simple so it’s easier for a beginner to pick up and start learning. In this tutorial we will learn how to create a simple punch out game where you the player will be boxing it out with the Tough Rob the opponent.  Both characters have their own health bars and can block attacks from their opponents. For this tutorial we are going to use Visual Studio 2017, Windows Form Application using the Visual C# programming language. You can use any version of visual studio to follow this tutorial because we are not going to use any external classes or game engines to make this punch out game.
